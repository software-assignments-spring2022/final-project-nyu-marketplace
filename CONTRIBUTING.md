# Guide to Contributing

## Team Norms
### Team Values
- Workload distributed equitably amongst team members during sprint planning.
- Each member is expected to keep up with their tasks, and to communicate obstacles to the team as early as possible.
- If a team member needs help with a task, they should communicate as such in the Discord channel as early as possible, so that the issue at hand can be discussed in the next Daily Standup.
- All broad scope planning and coordination should take place in the public discord channel.

### Sprint Cadence
- Two week sprint length.
<br>

### Daily Standups
<br>

### Coding Standards
- All team members will use Visual Studio Code as their designated editor, and  ...  as their designated linter.
- Code for each task must be peer reviewed before merging with main branch.
- Always ensure code is working before merging with main.
- Aim to make small commits, per feature or bug fix, and always provide concise and descriptive commit message.
- Delete commented out code before merging with main.
