# User Experience Design

## Appmap

Users are expected to start from the home page. If they are unlogged, they are not permitted to visit item or profile. They are also not allowed to use the search feature. Basically, unlogged users can only view the information of the app and sign in / register. For logged in users, they can search using keywords and / or by category in the home page, which will direct them to the store page, where multiple search results are shown. They can click any of the result to view the detailed information of the item, which will also allow them to order or favorite the item. The upper right corner will always be a link to the user profile, where users can view their personal info, sell new items, manage their sells, view their favorite items, and log out.
